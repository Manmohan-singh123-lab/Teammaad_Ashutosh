### Procedure

#### 1.Warm-Up and Equipment Setup

• Turn on all equipment (especially the noise source and analyzer) and allow to warm up for at least 15–30 minutes.

• Connect the amplifier (DUT) to the analyzer input using a coaxial cable.

• Connect the calibrated noise source to the amplifier input.


#### 2. Calibration

• Perform system calibration using the analyzer software:Connect the noise source directly to the analyzer.Run the noise source calibration routine (typically uses known Excess Noise Ratio – ENR values).This step removes the effects of the measurement system itself.


#### 3. Connect DUT

• After calibration, connect the amplifier between the noise source and the analyzer.Noise Source → Amplifier (DUT) → Analyzer


#### 4. Power On the Amplifier

• Supply the amplifier with the appropriate DC bias voltage/current.

• Confirm it is functioning properly (check output signal, gain, etc.).


#### 5. Perform Measurement

• Run the Noise Figure measurement on the analyzer.

• The analyzer will measure output noise with the noise source ON and OFF. Compute the amplifier’s Gain, Noise Figure (NF), 
and Y-Factor. Display results in dB.


#### 6. Record Results

• Record the measured values of: Noise Figure (NF) ,Gain ,Y-Factor , Frequency range over which the measurement was taken
